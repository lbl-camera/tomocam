This directory has all the source code needed to compile penalty_mex
for users of unsupported systems.
Self compiling and self compiled versions are unsupported...

One PC user (thank you!) reported that he was able to get this to compile
from withing matlab using this command:

	mex penalty_mex.c mexarg.c 'penalty,diff.c' -DIs_pc -DMmex -outdir ../v7
