This directory contains Matlab files
related to reconstruction of magnetic resonance (MR) images,
including fast iterative correction for field inhomogeneity.

The contents were created by Jeff Fessler, Doug Noll, and Brad Sutton.
Look for papers/preprints authored by Sutton at the web site:

The recon subdirectory has an example of iterative MR recon
with field correction.  It came originally from:
	/net/ir5/u/bpsutton/Reconitmr/
This recon code is now obsolete.  The "Gmri" object is now recommended.
See ../example/mri_*.m for usage.

Look at mri_phase_denoise.m for a somewhat incomplete example
of how we clean up our field maps before doing iterative recon.
