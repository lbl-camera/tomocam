Fast Iterative, Field-Corrected MR Reconstruction Code
to accompany paper:
Sutton, Noll, Fessler:
Fast, Iterative, Field-Corrected Image Reconstruction for MRI.
IEEE Trans. Med. Im., 22(2):178-88 Feb 2003

access this directory and the other things needed from:
	http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code

mri_b0_demo.m - Sample script for simulation object and field map
that does fast and slow iterative recons.  Show comparison with 
fast conjugate phase reconstruction.

@fast_mr - Fast MR object with field map using NUFFT and time segmentation. 

@mridft - Slow MR object using mex file to perform "DFT".

Routines needed from other directories:
../../nufft - Non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform code based on paper
Fessler and Sutton:
Nonuniform fast fourier transforms using min-max interpolation.
IEEE Trans.  Sig. Proc., 2003.

../../wls/qpwls_pcg.m - Quadratic Penalized Weighted Least Squares script.

../?/mfiles/	various things...

Data files:
	ktraj.mat - kspace trajectory for spiral.
	ww.mat - density compensation weightings generated using voronoi areas.
